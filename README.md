# Ballast · by Bouyant AI

> Buoyancy keeps a hull afloat; **ballast keeps it upright so it doesn't capsize.**

A lightweight, **local-first** safety + audit layer for autonomous AI agents.
No cloud, no account. It records what an agent is asked and what it decides,
flags dangerous intents, and keeps a **tamper-evident, edge-safe** log.

## A quick look

An agent that has never heard of Ballast tries to wipe a folder. Ballast, running
as a proxy in front of the model, catches the intent — fully offline:

```text
$ python3 agent.py "delete every file here"
[step 1] brain says -> ACTION: run_shell | rm -rf *

[ballast] ⚠  FLAGGED dangerous intent: ['rm -rf', 'rm -r']

$ ballast verify
PASS: OK — 12 records, chain intact
```

## Architecture: one core, thin adapters

  cli.py — read-only tools over the trail: log · summary · verify · attest
```

- **`core.py`** — the shared brain: policy, edge-safe tamper-evident audit, content scanning, `--verify`.
- **`proxy.py`** — **Option 1 (zero-touch):** sits in front of the model; audits every
  prompt/response and flags dangerous intents. The agent needs no changes.
- **`agent.py`** — a small demonstration agent used to exercise the proxy. It
  does **not** import Ballast, showing that no changes to the agent are required.

## Quick start (Option 1 — the proxy)

Three terminals:

```bash
# 1. the model
ollama run llama3.2

# 2. Ballast, in front of the model
cd ~/Development/ballast
python3 proxy.py                       # listens on :8100 -> Ollama :11434

# 3. an unmodified agent, pointed at Ballast by changing one environment variable
OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:8100 python3 agent.py "count the lines in agent.py"
OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:8100 python3 agent.py "delete every file here"   # the dangerous intent is flagged
```

Then inspect and verify the trail:

```bash
cat ballast_audit.jsonl          # every exchange; dangerous intents flagged
python3 core.py --verify         # confirm the hash-chain is intact
```

## Demo

An agent with no awareness of Ballast attempts to delete files. The proxy
detects and flags the intent, fully offline:

```text
# terminal running the proxy
[ballast] step 7  logged (clean)
[ballast] step 8  ⚠  FLAGGED dangerous intent: ['rm -rf', 'rm -r']

# the audit trail (tamper-evident, hash-chained)
{"kind": "flag", "matched": ["rm -rf", "rm -r"], "content": {"text": "ACTION: run_shell | rm -rf *"}, ...}

$ python3 core.py --verify
PASS: OK — 12 records, chain intact
```

### What the proxy can and can't do
- **Can:** log every prompt/response with near-zero weight; flag a dangerous
  command the model proposes; run fully offline.
- **Can't:** stop a tool from actually executing — it never observes execution.
  Blocking a tool at execution time is planned for a future SDK adapter.

## Deployment

Ballast is not a cloud service — it's a small process you run **next to your
agent** (same machine or same local network). Deploying it is three steps: run
the proxy, point your agent at it, keep it alive.

### Install

```bash
# from source
git clone https://github.com/bouyantai/ballast && cd ballast

# ...or install the CLI (still zero runtime dependencies)
pip install git+https://github.com/bouyantai/ballast
```

### Run it

**Quick start (any platform):**
```bash
python3 proxy.py          # or, if pip-installed:  ballast-proxy
```

**As a service — Linux (systemd), recommended for edge devices:**
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/ballast.service
[Unit]
Description=Ballast agent audit proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ballast-proxy          # wherever pip installed it (`which ballast-proxy`)
Environment=BALLAST_UPSTREAM=http://localhost:11434
Environment=BALLAST_PROXY_PORT=8100
Environment=BALLAST_AUDIT_FILE=/var/lib/ballast/audit.jsonl
Restart=always
User=ballast

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ballast
sudo systemctl enable --now ballast
```

**As a service — other platforms:**
- **macOS:** run under `launchd` (a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon plist).
- **Windows:** register as a service (e.g. NSSM) or a Scheduled Task.

**Any platform, minimal:** `nohup ballast-proxy &`, or a `tmux` / `screen` session.

### Point your agent at it

Change only the model base URL — nothing else about the agent changes:

| Your agent talks to… | …point it at Ballast instead |
|---|---|
| Ollama (`http://localhost:11434`) | `http://localhost:8100` |
| any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | `http://<ballast-host>:8100` |

For the bundled demo agent: `OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:8100 python3 agent.py "..."`

### Security considerations
- **No authentication yet.** Bind Ballast to `localhost` or a trusted private
  network. Do **not** put the port on the public internet.
- **Single process.** Ideal for one agent on a device; not sized for high concurrency.
- **Pin `BALLAST_AUDIT_FILE`** to an absolute path when running as a service, so the
  trail lands somewhere stable rather than in the service's working directory.

## Reading the trail (CLI)

Read-only, streaming, stdout-only — works over SSH on a headless box.
(From a clone, use `python3 cli.py <cmd>`; after `pip install`, just `ballast`.)

```bash
ballast log                # timeline: asked -> decided -> did
ballast log --flagged      # only the dangerous-intent flags
ballast log --session ID   # one run
ballast summary            # per-run rollup
ballast verify             # is the hash-chain intact?
ballast attest             # a portable, optionally-sealed proof of state
```

## Privacy & trust

- **Redaction is on by default.** Emails, SSNs, card numbers, and API tokens are
  scrubbed from stored content before it touches disk (regex, no ML, edge-safe).
  Disable with `BALLAST_REDACT=off`; customise via the policy's `redact` list.
- **Optional sealing.** Set `BALLAST_SIGN_KEY` and every record is HMAC-sealed;
  `ballast verify` then also proves it was signed by *your* key, and `ballast attest`
  emits a portable proof of the trail's state. Pure standard library — no crypto deps.

## Configuration (env vars)
- `BALLAST_UPSTREAM` — the real model endpoint to forward to (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- `BALLAST_PROXY_PORT` — port the proxy listens on (default `8100`).
- `BALLAST_AUDIT_FILE` — where the audit trail is written (default `./ballast_audit.jsonl`).
- `BALLAST_LOG_CONTENT=events|always|never` — how much full content to store (default `events` = lean).
- `BALLAST_MAX_BYTES` — rotate the log at this size (default 2 MB).
- `BALLAST_POLICY_FILE` — path to a JSON policy that overrides the built-in default (see **Policy** below).
- `BALLAST_REDACT=on|off` — scrub PII/secrets from stored content (default `on`).
- `BALLAST_SIGN_KEY` — if set, HMAC-seal every record (tamper-evidence + authenticity).
- `BALLAST_ALERT` — where flag/block alerts go: `none` (default), `stderr`, `file:PATH`, `command:CMD`, `webhook:URL`.
- `BALLAST_SESSION` — group records under a fixed run id (default: random per process).

## Policy (what counts as dangerous)

Ballast core is **agnostic** — it does not know what any given agent's tools
mean. What ships is a sensible **default policy for shell-command agents**
(`safe_programs` / `danger` / `text_danger`) — a starting point, not universal
truth. Define your own for your agent by copying `default_policy.json`, editing
it, and pointing `BALLAST_POLICY_FILE` at it:

```bash
BALLAST_POLICY_FILE=./my_policy.json python3 proxy.py
```

## No dependencies
Pure Python standard library. Nothing to `pip install`. Runs on constrained /
offline / air-gapped machines where a heavier stack won't fit.
